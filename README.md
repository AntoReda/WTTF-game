# WTTF-game
WTTF (Welcome to the forge) is a roguelike dungeon crawler that implements the use of crafting to progress. This project was created by 8 university students. I was in charge of level design, Audio, some art, room display, and merging each part correctly. 

# To run the code
[2 things need to be done to see the program on unity.] <br/>
1-Create a Unity project and replace your Assets and project settings with the ones included in my Unityfiles.zip. <br/>
2-Install the universal render pipeline in the package store for Unity (this will fix all the renderer issues you might have which sets everything to pink). <br/>

# How to play
-WASD to move <br/>
-Tab to open your inventory and close inventory. When inventory is open, click on an item to equip it <br/>
-Click on the forge table when character is close to open crafting menu. Walk away from table to close craft menu <br/>
-Q or E to quick swap weapons from your inventory
-Esc for pause menu
-Upon death you will recover your ressources which you can use to equip stronger armor and weapons
-You beat the game after beating each area boss (3)
